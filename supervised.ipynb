    "# Text Classification: Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous tutorial](https://earlyprint.org/jupyterbook/unsupervised.html), we attempted to use an unsupervised method, K-means clustering, to create groups or clusters of our 1666 texts into genres. But we concluded that clustering might not be the ideal method for our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, unsupervised methods aren't the only way we can classify texts. We can use *supervision*, or *supervised classification*, to sort our texts into groups based on our knowledge of existing categories. Essentially, we give the classifier some texts with categories already labeled and ask it to guess at categories for the unlabeled data. The term \"machine learning\" is most often used to describe to this process, because the classifier \"learns\" the categories based on the labeled samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The supervised classifier we'll use is one of the simplest and oldest: [logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), or logit. It's mathematically related to the common statistical technique of [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression). Where linear regression can predict *values*, logistic regression can predict *categories* (in other words: classify). While traditional logistic regression is a binary classifier, predicting whether data belongs in one of two categories, we can use multinomial logit to predict things in more than two categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the necessary libraries and functions. These are similar to our imports for unsupervised clustering, but with different libraries and models from `sklearn`."

    "\n",
    "This first step is identical to what we did in the last tutorial, loading our corpus of 1666 texts and getting Tf-Idf values for each word. Here's an important note from the last lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    ">In previous tutorials, we extracted lists of words from the XML files and converted them to Tf-Idf values using `TfidfTransformer`. That would still work in this case, but in order to place some additional limits on Tf-Idf, we'll convert the text from our XML back into strings. We can put those strings into `TfIdfVectorizer`, which will give us access to those additional limits (see below). The next code block extracts all the lemmas from our texts and converts them into strings."

Scikit-learn provides [many options and parameters](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer) for its `TfidfVectorizer` that aren't available in the `TfidfTransformer` we used in previous tutorials. Specifically, we want to use the `min_df` parameter to set the minimum document frequency to 2: this will filter out all words that appear in fewer than two texts. This creates a smaller list of features and will allow our models to run more quickly and more accurately."

We'll use two of the most common subject labels in *EarlyPrint*: history and poetry. We'll also have a third \"neither\" category for texts that don't belong to either group.\n",

In a real research situation you may want your categories to be more precise, and you may want a more apples-to-apples comparison than history and poetry, which are very different.

    "Now that we have target labels, we can use them to train a *supervised classifier* to determine genre categories. Unlike with K-means clustering, where we simply create a model and plug in the entire dataset, we need to split our data into a *training set*, which we use to help our model learn, and a *test set*, which we use to see how the model did. In our case, we'll split our data approximately in half, using just over half of the plays for training and reserving the rest for testing. \n",

    "\n",
    "Once the data is split, we can choose a model to train. In this case, the method I've chosen is logistic regression (logit). As I mentioned before, logit is quite an old method for classification, and it is useful in part because it is easy to explain and provides results that (as we shall see) are easier to interpret than newer methods like neural networks. Logistic regression uses a logistic function to draw an s-shaped [sigmoid curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) that takes any value and converts it to a value between 0 and 1. The closer the value is to 0 or 1, the more closely it belongs in one category or another. Because of this 0-or-1, one-or-the-other feature, logit was originally only a *binary* classifier: it could only tell if something was in one of just two categories. However, we can use multiclass or multinomial logistic regression, and the model will predict all three of our classes at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we'll split the data automatically, create a logistic regression model, and \"fit\" that model using the training data. Then, we'll run the model to *predict* categories for the texts in the test set. In the end, we can get accuracy scores, as well as a list of the texts in the test set with their real and predicted genres."

    "The results above show us a few things about how the logistic regression model did. First, the *accuracy score* shows the percentage of texts in the test set that were labeled correctly in this run of the model. 75% accuracy is pretty good for a first attempt!\n",
    "\n",
    "And the results themselves show that the model got things mostly right. By browsing the list above, we can see that most of the expected and predicted values match.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's a catch: the majority of our texts are in the \"neither\" category, i.e. they're neither poetry nor history. If the model guesses \"neither\" most of the time, it's likely to be right most of the time. The question, then, is: how well did the model *actually* do at identifying the texts in these very different categories? There are a few ways of finding out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing a Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "After training a classifier, we naturally want to know if it worked. One way we can do this is by scanning a list of results, as above. We can look at the texts that are listed and find out if the mistakes the model made were interesting: perhaps some of the texts are mislabeled and the model is right that they really *are* poetry or history. And it's important to do this kind of close-reading check for any model. A humanities researcher may care as much about what a model gets wrong as what it gets right: the point isn't training a computer to do a task for us, it's what we learn about our corpus by going through the process of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to that end, in addition to examining examples, there are a range of mathematical ways to assess a classifier. We already calculated an accuracy score in the code above, which tells us how often the classifier picked the correct category. However, this is only the accuracy result for the data split in just one way and run just once. How does the model do if we split up the data differently?\n",
    "\n",
    "The *cross validation score* answers this question by running the model several times with differently split data. We can use a technique called [*k*-fold cross-validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)#k-fold_cross-validation), where *k* refers to any possible number. This method splits the data up differently *k* number of times and calculates the average accuracy across the differently-split runs of the classifier. Maybe in one random run, the data winds up split in such a way that the model is much more accurate than it is every other time it's run. Cross-validation accounts for this and gives us a sense of how well the model does no matter how the data is split. We can see that the cross validation shows that this particular run of the model is fairly close to the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "With `sklearn`, running *k*-fold cross-validation is as simple as one line of code. We'll do 5-fold cross-validation by setting `cv=5`. This means that `sklearn` will run the model 5 different ways:"

When the two match, we can see the number of *true positives*, places where the predicted value matched the expected value. Those are the darker squares along the diagonal from top left to bottom right. Our model got history right 11 times, poetry right 21 times, and correctly predicted when a text was neither 60 times. \n",

Like we saw in the list above, the model miscategorized 3 texts originally labeled \"neither\" as poetry, for example.

Instead, history texts are sometimes misclassified as \"neither,\" and \"neither\" texts are sometimes misclassified as history.\n",

    "The classification report gives us scores for the [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) of the classifier across each category. Precision is the ratio of true positives (correct guesses of a text's category) to the number of total times it guessed that category. Recall is the ratio of true positives to the total number of texts in that category that existed in the dataset. So precision tells us how often the model guessed correctly while recall tells us how often the model found the right thing—two different views of a similar task. (If this is still confusing to you, I highly recommend the examples and visualizations in the [Wikipedia article on this topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall).)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [F1-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall#F-measure) combines these two measures, and \"support\" just shows the number of times that category appeared in our dataset (i.e. the total number of texts with that label).\n",
    "\n",
    "How did our classifier do, according to this report? It did a decent job with the \"neither\" category, which makes sense since \"neither\" was the largest category. And it did really well with poetry! Especially with recall: if there was poetry in a text, our classifier could find it. Given that verse is distinctive compared to a nebulous genre like \"history,\" it makes sense that this was the classifier's strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can can see that the history category is where the classifier really struggled. In fact, it's what's dragging down our overall accuracy score.  Both precision and recall are less than 50%: the classifier can neither find historical texts nor guess their label correctly. It's worse than a coin flip!\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification report clarifies trends that were harder to see in our other methods of model assessment. Namely, one category (history) is badly suited to this method. Perhaps we could create a classifier that's quite good at identifying poetry texts, but we need to go back to the drawing board on history. This makes sense since, as I mentioned previously, \"history\" isn't a very well-defined genre in this corpus. Instead it's a subject label applied to lots of different kinds of texts. If we're really interested in correctly classifying historical texts, we may want to hand label a sample and start over with our model.\n",

    "Just as we discovered with K-means clustering, it's easy to run these models but harder to assess and interpret their results. It requires a knowledge of the task at hand, a general idea of what's in the corpus, and a willingness to drill down to specific examples. The example we worked through above didn't work perfectly, and that makes it a good object lesson in supervised classification. You won't always find the right model or the right categories on the first try, and that's okay. By applying your knowledge of the corpus and some general principles of how classifiers work, you can still learn something from imperfect classifiers and work toward a model that does the job."
